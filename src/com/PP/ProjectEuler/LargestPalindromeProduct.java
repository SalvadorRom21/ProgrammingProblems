A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Solution:

To solve this problem we will brute force it. We will multiply both digits by 999 all the way up to 0;
Along the way we will check if the product is a palindrome and if it is we will store it in a list
once we have gathered the whole list we will sort it and return the first value aka the biggest
this will be our answer

Time Complexity O(n^2) - We have to go through 2 for loops which makes this n * n
Space Complexity O(log(n)) This is O(log(n)) because we only store the values that are palindromes
and not every product.
